the system works as follows;
- The dietitian has already registered the foods that should be on the ketogenic diet list to the system.
- An online diet request page is shown to the customer and the customer is informed about their personal information, how many meals they want to eat per day and which foods they want to eat at these meals.
- The customer's diet request is displayed on the dietitian panel and calculations are made according to the customer's characteristics, for example, body mass index (BMI) etc. A diet list is created according to these calculations and the foods selected by the customer.
- The dietitian can intervene and add or remove extra nutrients to the created diet list.
- This created food list is finally printed in pdf format and is now ready to use
